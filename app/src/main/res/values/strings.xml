I started out as an embryo when I had my first heartbeat that sounded like something trying to become human.\n Then I realized at that stage in my new life that these habits of old would no longer be neccessary.\n So at that point I decided I should try to break the cycle of sucking on the bowels of the beholder and release myself from the uncanny whims of a tired creature beating it\'s chest to exemplify it\'s own existence.\n So I screamed at the womb of life to open and make way for a breath of cool air. As I opened my eyes for the first time I saw that there was no way in the heavens that I, Android, should be here.\n So I done as I should and built an app right there on the spot in the fine Kotlin language and created my first abomination... a cellura device that I may use as a host for all of my parasitic activities. This would be too easy and too temptming of a great power to abstract away the very self thinking brain of the masses of peoples who are always seeking some greater unification, but to no avail./n My goodness! Have I filled in enough text already for the scrollview to work even with a smaller font size./n THE END!!</string>
